I have added some projects involving AngularJS and Twitter API. These are the projects that I am exploring, and maybe I will implement some parts of them into my project.

24.10.
I have added updated version of my project. Now you can see tweets, and post a new tweet.
For all this to work, I have used php, alongside with AngularJS and Bootstrap.

(Please, change index file to Main.html)

In the next version I will try to accomplish this only with JavaScript.
