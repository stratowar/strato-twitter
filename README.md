Added one new project (JavaTwitter). It is based on TwitterWithoutPHP project, but it is using JSP to implement and open index page of the project. I have made new library, called HTML, and used it to make coding on the JSP page easier.

Updated PhpTwitter project. Now you can post a tweet too.

I have added a new project (TwitterWithoutPHP). In this project you are authorized via Oauth.io,
you connect to the Twitter, gain a tokken, and after that you can view my timeline, post a new tweet, and delete tweets.

24.10.
I have added updated version of my project (PhpTwitter). Now you can see tweets, and post a new tweet.
For all this to work, I have used php, alongside with AngularJS and Bootstrap.

(Please, change index file to Main.html)

In the next version I will try to accomplish this only with JavaScript.

I have added some projects involving AngularJS and Twitter API. These are the projects that I am exploring, and maybe I will implement some parts of them into my project.
